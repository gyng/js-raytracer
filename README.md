js-raytracer
============

Likely incorrect JS raytracer.

## Have
* Octree
* Shadows
* Reflections
* Refractions
* Materials: Phong, Lambertian, Flat, Cook-Torrance shading
* Rudimentary OBJ mesh loading: click the bunny button!

## Missing
* WebWorkers for parallel rendering
* Fresnel calculations for reflect/refract strength

A rewrite to clean up code and use web workers is pending.

## Usage
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Run `index.html` in a web browser.
